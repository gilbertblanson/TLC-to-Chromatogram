An interactive ShinyApp that takes your TLC results and turns them into predicted chromatograms for manual silica column chromatography.

## Getting Started

You can access the app on any device at [ansonc.shinyapps.io/TLC-Chromatogram/](ansonc.shinyapps.io/TLC-Chromatogram/). To run it locally, download the app.R and run it in RStudio.
